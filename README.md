# LinkTree / Shorby replacement
This is a simple 'slot in' replacement for LinkTree. If you don't know LinkTree, this is a site that lets you gather all your links in one place, handy for sites that only let you have one link like Instgram.

### Advantages
- Use your own domain
- No LinkTree link
- Use your own meta tags

### Disadvantages
- Takes 20 minutes to set up

## Development
This is a static site with NO JavaScript. This means it is trivially easy to host on any web server. I suggest using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host this site since you can do this for FREE.
